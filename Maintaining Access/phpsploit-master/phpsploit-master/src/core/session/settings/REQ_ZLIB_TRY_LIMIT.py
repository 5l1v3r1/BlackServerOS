"""
This setting adjusts from what payload size
the zlib compression feature is disabled.

The framework requests engine looks for the best
way to spread the payload with a minimum of http
requests when payloads are large.
Therefore, the compression feature is exponentially
cpu greedy, so it is a good practice to set
the limit according to the cpu capacity of your
machine.
