"""
This variable contains php code which is interpreted
on each http request, just before payload execution.

This setting can be used for example in order to
override a php configuration option with a value
that extends execution scope.

The code will be executed before ANY payload execution.

NOTE: If you do not understand what you're doing,
      keep this setting with default value.
