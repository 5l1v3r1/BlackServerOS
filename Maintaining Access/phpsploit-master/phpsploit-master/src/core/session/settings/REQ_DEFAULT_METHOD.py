"""
Default HTTP method to use in requests.

The phpsploit framework supports both GET
and POST methods for sending HTTP requests.

GET METHOD:
-----------
  MODUS OPERANDI:
    The $PASSKEY payload launcher is passed as a
    single header, and all other available headers
    are fullfilled in a fragmented manner with
    the obfuscated php payload according to
    $HTTP_MAX_HEADERS and $HTTP_MAX_HEADER_SIZE
    settings limitations.
  DESCRIPTION:
    This method is usually more stealth than
    POST, because most of HTTP requests in
    the web use the GET method.
    Therefore, the amount of payload that can
    be injected in a single request is generally
    limited by remote web server's maximum headers
    and maximum size of each header.
POST METHOD:
------------
  MODUS OPERANDI:
    The $PASSKEY payload launcher is passed as a
    single header, and the php payload is sent
    through a POST argument, according to
    $HTTP_MAX_POST_SIZE settings limitations.
  DESCRIPTION:
    Choosing this method is usually interesting
    when sending a large payload wich otherwise
    needs the sending of a lot more GET requests.
    Using this method can also be useful when the
    target is usually called with post requests for
    stealth purposes, but this is rarely the case.
