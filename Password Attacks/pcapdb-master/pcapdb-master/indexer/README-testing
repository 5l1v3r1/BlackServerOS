After building, running make test in the 'build' directory
will run a series of unit tests on the capture system. For all of 
these tests to succeed, some additional steps are necessary.

1. You will have to setup your system to at least partly
    have the components of a live capture system. This includes:
  a. The pcapdb/ld.so.conf file will need to be installed as
    /etc/ld.so.d/pcapdb.conf so the system can find the 
    pfring libraries.
  b. The DB tests require an accessible postgreSQL database
    with the proper tables installed. The Makefile in pcapdb/
    has a test_db target that will accomplish this on the
    local system (given postgres is installed). You can also
    use a remote server. 
2. Most of tests can run as any user, but a few (the live
    capture tests) must be run as root.
3. You'll need a representative PCAP file. Change the
    soft-link in pcapdb/indexer/tests/data to point to your
    file. Do not actually include your file in repository. A
    PCAP file of 1-4GB in size is reasonable.
