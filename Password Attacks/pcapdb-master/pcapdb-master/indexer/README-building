#### Requirements ####
If you've installed everything in the sys-requirements.txt file you should be good to go, mostly. 

 - If cmake claims to be missing a library you're sure you have, first try doing a make clean before running make again.
 - The PostgreSQL library is often installed problematically. It's expected to live in 
   '/usr/include/postgresql', but the RHEL RPMs install it in '/usr/pgsql-<version>/include'. 
   To fix this, just make a softlink in /usr/include to point to the correct location.

#### Building ####
Simply running make in the indexer directory will build the project in indexer/build. 

#### Installing ####
'make install' will install everything in the default location of '/var/capture'. 
For development purposes though, you can install it in your project site directory (one up from 
this directory) by giving a DESTDIR environment variable. For example:
'make install DESTDIR=/home/<username>/pcapdb'
