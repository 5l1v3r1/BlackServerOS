modified version of spike 2.9 with the network specific stuff stripped 
out, and some simple hackish code to facilitate in locally 
discovering/logging file format issues. this probably should have simply 
been merged into a full version of spike, but oh well. this was 
designed/tested on linux and will not work on cygwin because it uses 
ptrace. if you want to make it work on cygwin, you will need to remove the 
ptrace stuff and just log return values from each child. it shouldnt work 
on any other systems.

Known Issues:
Does not segfault when it finds a 0day. This functionality may be added 
in later releases :>

to install, please see INSTALL

quirks:

some apps like Acrobat and RealPlayer are really shell scripts that set special environment variables before launching the
actual binary. be aware of this, it's easy to get around.

RealPlayer:
HELIX_PATH must be set, and realplay.bin must be used as the binary.

Adobe Acrobat:
first invoke the shell script with -DEBUG, then run from there. the actual binary
is usually in Adobe/Acrobat7.0/Reader/intellinux/bin/acroread
