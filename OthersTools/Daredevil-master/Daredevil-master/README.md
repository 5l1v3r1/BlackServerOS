# Daredevil
*His senses function with superhuman accuracy and sensitivity, giving him abilities far beyond the limits of a sighted person*

Daredevil is a tool to perform (higher-order) correlation power analysis attacks (CPA). 
It allows the user to compute CPA attacks on multiple cores given a specified amount 
of memory. The initial release of Daredevil implements the fastest approaches as 
outlined in the paper

## Dependencies

This software only requires a compiler with OpenMP support (by default clang).  
E.g. on a Debian/Ubuntu environment, one can do:

```bash
sudo apt-get install --no-install-recommends clang make
```

## Installation

To compile daredevil simply run:

```bash
make
```

To install it simply run:

```bash
sudo make install
```

You can uninstall it with:

```bash
sudo make uninstall
```

You can also specify the compiler with the CC variable as well as an
installation prefix else than the default /usr/local:

```bash
make CC=g++
sudo make install PREFIX=/usr
```

If you've troubles using clang with OpenMP on your distribution, try
using g++ as explained above.
